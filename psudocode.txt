Let maxNumber represent the biggest number, set it to zero to start
While there are still numbers left in the list
	Look at the next number in the list
	Compare it to the maxNumber
		If next number is greater than maxNumber
			Set maxNumber to that number
Report maxNumber as the biggest in the list


Errors: Line 5 change "smaller" to "greater". 
Reason: maxNumber should be greatest number according to line 1 and maxNumber should be updated after every comparison from line 4.
